# Rust Vector Index Out of Bounds

This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: accessing an element in a Vector using an index that is out of bounds. This can lead to a panic at runtime if not handled correctly.

The `bug.rs` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.rs` file shows how to handle the potential error using the `.get()` method and pattern matching.

This is a simple example of how to avoid common errors in Rust. Please feel free to raise issues or submit PRs!
